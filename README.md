## Project brief
Build a fun, educational app for art lovers and children alike. Tell the difference between your Monets and Michaelangos, and we're not talking about the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles!

This was loosely inspired by the hit 90s TV programme.

## User stories
* As someone short on time, I want to be able to practice my drawing skills, so I don't get rusty
* As a parent, I want to give my child a creative outlet so they're able to develop their creativity and learn about art
* As someone who doesn't know much about art, I want to develop an appreciation, so I can show off with my new found knowledge
